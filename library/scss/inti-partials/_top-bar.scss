Stylesheet: Top Bar

Inti Foundation includes a F6 .top-bar to which ul.menu's are added
wrapped in F6 classes that determine if they are floated.

By default, this top bar, as a well as all the visible page is placed
within a F6 off-canvas's .off-canvas-content wrapper, outside of
which an off canvas menu is found.

On smaller screens the top bar shows a button that triggers the 
off canvas menu, and hides the main navigation menu

/**
 * Sticky Elements
 *
 * (The following goes in _top-bar because we generally just make the top bar sticky, not the whole
 * site-header, though we could) 
 *
 * Notes: Generally we called anything less than mlarge "mobile" as this incompasses
 * smaller tablets, tablets held in portrait and cell phones. This is where we switch
 * to the off-canvas menu by default.
 * 782px is the screen width that the Admin Bar in WordPress changes height from 32px to 46px
 *
 * This makes the existing top-bar sticky. If you have a sticky sidebar too, this will interfere,
 * you'll have to add more top margin to the sidebar when both are sticky. Users are given the option
 * to make sidebars sticky in Customize, in Page Options. You may want to hide that for your user.
 *
 * Foundation's Sticky feature makes the existing top-bar with the main navigation menu appear to stick
 * to the top of the page. It would generaly have the same design. If in your design you are displaying
 * the logo alongside the menu, you probably wrapped the sticky div around that too. If not, you might
 * want to add a logo into the top-bar when it is sticky - the mobile banner logo is already there - you
 * could show that.
 *
 * You can of course load a whole new top-bar once you scroll past the main one, and that can have its 
 * own style, but then you don't need the sticky functionality. 
 *
